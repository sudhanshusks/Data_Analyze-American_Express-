# Problem Statement
You have to create a list of applications in the order in which Banco should process them. With an objective to maintain healthy financials, Banco would like to process least risky applications first. Against each application, you also have to provide your prediction of default - 1 or 0, where 1 indicates a default and 0 indicates no default.

## Assume:
•	A resident of the city can submit only a single application form <br/>
•	None of the applications submitted are fraudulent <br/>
•	State any other assumptions in your final submission <br/>
